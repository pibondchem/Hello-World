# Hello-World
I am a synthetic inorganic chemist - skilled in synthesis and characterization of air sensitive organometallic 
compounds.  Most of my doctoral research involved Schlenk and Inert Atmosphere Box methods.  Since earning
my Ph. D., I have taught at a small liberal arts college in Minnesota.  As half of a two-person department, 
I was responsible for Analytical chemistry/Instrumental analysis, Inorganic chemistry, and the Physical
chemistry sequence.  In addition, I maintained our instruments and helped manage the stockroom and chemical
inventory.

For several years, I also taught the first year of physics (both the algebra based and calculus based courses) 
and began to develop micro-controller based labs.  From this experience, I decided it was time to learn
some coding & have started with Python 3.8.

Due to low enrollments, my position was eliminated in 2020.  I taught as a visiting assistant professor at the 
state university last year and am currently seeking a permanent position in academia or industry.
